This repository contains code for performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) using the Facebook S2T (Speech-to-Text) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned on the LibriSpeech dataset.

## Description
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the Facebook S2T ASR model to transcribe audio files into text. It includes loading the model, resampling audio to a desired sampling rate, preparing the input, and generating transcriptions.

## Usage
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Hugging Face Transformers
PyTorch
Torchaudio

## Getting Started - 
1. Load the Facebook S2T ASR Model
2. Load the Audio file
3. Resample Audio to Desired Sampling Rate
4. Prepare Input for the Mode
5. Generate Transcription
